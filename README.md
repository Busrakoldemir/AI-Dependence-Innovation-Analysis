# The Impact of AI Dependence on Individual Innovation

## 📌 Project Overview
This research explores the relationship between university students' reliance on AI tools and their innovative behaviors. Contrary to the common belief that AI hinders creativity, our findings suggest that AI dependence acts as a **"cognitive scaffold"** that motivates innovation.

## Key Findings
* **Correlation:** A significant positive relationship (r = .409, p < .001) between AI Dependence and Innovation.
* **Predictive Power:** AI dependence explains **16.7%** of the variance in innovative behavior.
* **Observation:** Higher AI dependence scores are consistently associated with higher innovative output.

## Methodology & Tools
* **Software:** IBM SPSS Statistics.
* **Sample:** N=124 undergraduate students (Data screened from N=130).
* **Techniques Used:**
    * Data Cleaning & Screening.
    * Scale Reliability Analysis (Cronbach’s Alpha: .89 - .98).
    * Descriptive Statistics.
    * Pearson Correlation & Linear Regression.
